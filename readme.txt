Cuckooland / BUas Intake (2024)

1. Description

Wake up esteemed test subject, we've got experiments to conduct regarding our new tool. We've hid cuckoos all over the place -and since none of us feel like getting up from our chairs- we need you to collect them for us.
Why did we hide cuckoos all over the place? Don't ask questions, just do as you're told. We're watching you.

2. How to play

In this game, the player is given a Transform Cannon, a tool that can move, rotate and bring objects closer or further away. 
The player must use this tool to solve puzzles and **collect** cuckoos.

- WASD to move
- SPACE to jump
- HOLD Right Mouse to zoom
- [Transform Cannon] HOLD Left Mouse to move objects
- [Transform Cannon] HOLD R and move mouse to rotate objects
- [Transform Cannon] Mouse Wheel to bring objects closer or further away
