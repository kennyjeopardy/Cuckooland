## Description

Wake up esteemed test subject, we've got experiments to conduct regarding our new tool. We've hid cuckoos all over the place -and since none of us feel like getting up from our chairs- we need you to collect them for us.
Why did we hide cuckoos all over the place? Don't ask questions, just do as you're told. We're watching you.

## How to play

In this game, the player is given a Transform Cannon, a tool that can move, rotate and bring objects closer or further away. 
The player must use this tool to solve puzzles and **collect** cuckoos.

- <kbd>WASD</kbd> to move
- <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to jump
- HOLD <kbd>Right Mouse</kbd> to zoom
- [Transform Cannon] HOLD <kbd>Left Mouse</kbd> to move objects
- [Transform Cannon] HOLD <kbd>R</kbd> and move mouse to rotate objects
- [Transform Cannon] <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> to bring objects closer or further away
