# Cuckooland / BUas Intake (2024)

A game by Oktay Can Ismar a.k.a. kennyjeopardy

## Description

Wake up esteemed test subject, we've got experiments to conduct regarding our new tool. We've hid cuckoos all over the place -and since none of us feel like getting up from our chairs- we need you to collect them for us.
Why did we hide cuckoos all over the place? Don't ask questions, just do as you're told. We're watching you.

## How to play

In this game, the player is given a matter manipulator, a tool that can move, rotate and bring objects closer or further away. 
The player must use this tool to solve puzzles and **collect** cuckoos.
